        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together the plum sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, and pepper flakes in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shrimp with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
                Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
                Transfer to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Add the scallion whites, garlic and ginger to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until soft, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the vinegar and scrape up any brown bits that cling to the bottom of the skillet. Add the plum-ketchup sauce and bring to a simmer.
                Return the shrimp to the skillet along with the scallion greens and give the skillet a swirl to bring everything together.</li>
            <li>Divide among 4 plates and serve with white rice if using.</li>
