        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Turmeric (and its yellow pigment, curcumin) has become a hugely popular supplement in recent years, and for good reason. 
            Rarely does an herb exert its health benefits so broadly and effectively throughout the whole body. 
            I recommend it daily for people who are looking for general preventative and health maintenance strategies,
            as well as those with specialised health concerns.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Part Of The Mixture:</strong>
                Before you can start with cooking, you must preheat your broiler. While that happens, you can form the first topping mixture. 
                Firstly you should mix honey and vinegar in a bowl. Next, add half a teaspoon salt to it and then jalapenos.
                After adding jalapenos, stir the mixture so that they are covered. Then put the bowl aside and move to step two.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare The Chicken And Pan:</strong>
                Firstly you have to prepare the chicken before cooking it. So take out a large bowl and place the meat in it.
                After that, add the following ingredients in these quantities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Turmeric - 1 teaspoon</li>
                    <li>Olive oil - 1 tablespoon</li>
                    <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
                    <li>A small amount of black pepper for taste</li>
                </ul>
                Once you add these things to the bowl, be sure to stir the pieces gently. Then move on to preparing the pan. 
                You will need a nonstick skillet of large size. Add two tablespoons of olive oil to it and place it on medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <Strong>Cook The Pieces:</Strong> 
                As soon as the pan heats up a bit, add the chicken pieces to it.
                Toss them frequently until they change color. This should take about ten or twelve minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook The Spinach:</strong>
                When the time runs out, transfer the pieces to the plate. Then put spinach and grated garlic from 1 clove to the pan.
                for one to two minutes. The spinach should still be in vibrant color.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Form The Remaining Mixture:</strong> 
                Add the remaining turmeric, garlic, yogurt, and salt (¼ teaspoon) to a bowl. Then put the lemon juice as well and whisk everything.
                You can add some black pepper, too, if you want. Mix until a smooth mixture forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make The Flatbread:</strong> 
                Take out the baking pan, put a sheet over it, and spread the last tablespoon of olive oil on it.
                Add the naan and broil until crispy. This should take two or three minutes.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Top The Naan:</strong>
                Firstly place the cooked spinach on the flatbread. Then add the chicken pieces.
                After that, top it with the jalapenos from the first mixture and cilantro leaves.
                Then pour the yogurt sauce.
            </li>
        </ol>
