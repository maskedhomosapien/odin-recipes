        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Turmeric (and its yellow pigment, curcumin) has become a hugely popular supplement in recent years, and for good reason. 
            Rarely does an herb exert its health benefits so broadly and effectively throughout the whole body. 
            I recommend it daily for people who are looking for general preventative and health maintenance strategies,
            as well as those with specialised health concerns.
        </p>
